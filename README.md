## G
Fast aliases for Python, Git, and a few other tools. 
Saves time and mental effort on commands that get run all the time. 
It is called G because when I started I only had git aliases.

### To use

`source g.sh`

Note that there are a lot of aliases, and although I try to make them as intuitive
as possible, i.e. `gs` being `git status`, it is still difficult to memorize them.
I've been incrementally adding them, and that is probably the easiest way to use
them.

### Requirements

Any version of Python, no external packages needed

### Future Work

If you have other aliases, for git, arcanist or another tool, let me know!
